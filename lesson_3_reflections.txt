When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-------
I would want to do this maybe for a couple of reasons. The first is that it would make collaborating on a bit of code much easier. Another reason would be to make a copy of certain branches or committs available to the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
------
This gives a user more control over the point at which he or she wants to modify the software.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
------
Forks are taking a copy of a branch of somebody's public commit on gitHub. A clone is a copy of a local repository. A branch is a line of commits for a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-------------
Helps with knowing if you need to merge or not I suppose.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
---------
Without GitHub I would make a massive room full of cubicles!!!! And folks would just have to talk to each other. Heck, it'd save them the 15-20 hours that I had to spend taking this course!
