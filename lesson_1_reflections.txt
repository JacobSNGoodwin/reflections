How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Diff showed only parts of the files that were changed. This allowed my to not have to look through an entire file.
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better programmer in the long term?

    It could help several users track where changes were made. This could also help users with bug tracking.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
    
    I guess in google you may not get the snapshot you would like, as you have no control over when it automatically save. I could see instances where it saves too many snapshots and others where it would save too few.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I really have no idea here. I guess git is more about coding and project dependencies. Google docs is more about completing a single word processing file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    You use git log to see commits made, and then you can see how the files have changed between various commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    
    If you break something beyond repair, no need to try to remember how it was before. Just check out a former version!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I think I would like to use it for my first simple webpage. Perhaps a simple resume page.
