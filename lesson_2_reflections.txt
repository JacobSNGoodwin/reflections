What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a repository for the files in a given folder, which means you can now track changes in this folder/repository. I think you need to do this because you shouldn't keep everything under version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	I guess it just means you have made the changes, but there are other files that still might need changes. I suppose that is the value it offers.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can use this to make sure you only stage files or things that have actually changed. You can leave the other files alone
